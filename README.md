### Options

| key | default | required | description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| token | | yes | Your Plex token [(Find your Plex token)](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)
| host | localhost | Required if server_name not used | The host Plex is running on (Not required if Plex is accessable outside your network and server_name is used).
| port | 32400 | Required if server_name not used | The port Plex is running on (Not required if Plex is accessable outside your network and server_name is used).
| server_name |  | Required if host & port aren't used | The name of your Plex server. Can be found in Plex's server settings in "General".
| ssl | false | no | Set to true if you use SSL to access Plex.
| max | 5 | no | Max number of items to show in sensor.
| download_images | true | no | Setting this to false will turn off downloading of images, but will require certain Plex settings to work. See below.
| ssl_cert | false | no | If you provide your own SSL certificate in Plex's network settings set this to true.

#### By default this addon automatically downloads images from Plex to your /www/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/ directory. The directory is automatically created & only images reported in the upcoming list are downloaded. Images are small in size and are removed automatically when no longer needed. Currently & unfortunately, this may not work on all systems.

#### If you prefer to not download the images you may set download_images to false, but you either have to set "Secure connections" to "preferred" or "disabled" (no SSL) or have a custom certificate set (these options are found in your Plex server's network settings). This is needed because the default SSL certificate supplied by Plex is for their own domain and not for your Plex server. Your server also needs to be "fully accessible outside your network" if you wish to be able to see images remotely. If your Plex server provides it's own certificate you only need to set ssl_cert to true and download_images to false.
