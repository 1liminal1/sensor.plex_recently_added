</br>

## Installation:

1. Install this component by copying to your `/custom_components/sensor/` folder.
2. Install the card: [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card)
2. Add the code to your `configuration.yaml` using the config options below.
3. Add the code for the card to your `ui-lovelace.yaml`. 
3. **You will need to restart after installation for the component to start working.**

### Options

| key | default | required | description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| token | | yes | Your Plex token [(Find your Plex token)](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)
| host | localhost | no | The host Plex is running on.
| port | 32400 | no | The port Plex is running on.
| ssl | false | no | Whether or not to use SSL for Plex.
| max | 5 | no | Max number of items in sensor.
| remote_images | true | no | If you don't access Home Assistant remotely, setting this to false will turn off downloading of images. More info below.

#### By default this addon automatically downloads images from Plex to your /www/custom-lovelace/upcoming-media-card/ directory. The directory is automatically created & only images reported in upcoming list are downloaded. Images are small in size and are removed automatically when no longer in the upcoming list. This is required to view the images remotely.

#### If you don't access Home Assistant remotely you may set remote_images to false, but you also have to set "Secure connections" to "preferred" or provide your own certificate in your Plex server's network settings. This is because the default SSL certificate supplied by Plex is for their own domain and not for your Plex server.

### Sample for configuration.yaml:

    sensor:
    - platform: plex_recently_added
      token: YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN (See link above on how to obtain)
      host: 192.168.1.4
      port: 32400
      ssl: true
      max: 10

### Sample for ui-lovelace.yaml:

    - type: custom:upcoming-media-card
      entity: sensor.plex_recently_added
